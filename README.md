# Android Project - Group 36

- This ReadMe file contains the details of the project, how to build/execute the app, and notes on GenAI use. 

## Building and Running the App
- Since this app was done natively without importing any libraries, this should not be a difficult process.

1. Start by cloning the repository. 
```bash

git clone https://github.com/ayushp0728/Android36.git

```

2. Afterwards, install all required dependencies and ensure that you have the correct emulator set. 

#### Please note that due to prior issues, we had to restart our project and rename it to Android36Java internally. So, copying over the files will likely create some kind of break if you are expecting Android<group_number>. Sorry for the trouble. 



# GenAI Usage Summary – Android Photos App

This document explains **how GenAI tools were used** during development of the Android Photos app, in accordance with the assignment guidelines.

---

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT** (used intermittently as a helper)
- Development was done entirely in **Android Studio**, using **Java** and **Android XML**

---

## Overall Approach

The app was **not generated by GenAI**.  
We built the project ourselves by **incrementally porting our JavaFX Photos app to Android**, implementing features screen-by-screen and use-case-by-use-case.

GenAI was used **selectively** as a support tool to:
- Clarify Android-specific concepts
- Help debug errors
- Assist with isolated UI or adapter logic when needed

All architectural decisions, feature breakdown, and integration were driven by us.

## What We (Students) Implemented

We were responsible for:
- Designing the **overall app structure and navigation flow**
- Porting and adapting **core data models** (`Album`, `Photo`, `Tag`, `DataStore`)
- Implementing **all required features** from the assignment:
  - Album CRUD
  - Photo add/remove/display
  - Slideshow navigation
  - Tagging (person/location only)
  - Moving photos between albums
  - Global search with AND / OR / NONE logic
- Writing and wiring all Activities
- Handling data persistence and lifecycle updates
- Debugging behavior using the Android emulator
- Ensuring compliance with all assignment requirements

---

## How GenAI Was Used

GenAI assisted in **small, focused ways**, including:
- Helping translate JavaFX-style layouts into **Android XML**
- Assisting with **RecyclerView adapter patterns**
- Debugging Android-specific errors (imports, XML attributes, lifecycle issues)
- Refining search logic for **case-insensitive and prefix-based matching**
- Writing UI or listener implementations when requested

All GenAI-generated code was reviewed, modified, and integrated manually.

---

## What GenAI Did Not Do

- Did **not** generate the entire app or major features in a single prompt
- Did **not** dictate project structure or feature design
- Did **not** replace student-written logic
- Did **not** eliminate the need for testing or debugging
